This repository houses the code of analysis of the data related to covid19 cases in India.

# Credits
The dataset used in this project is from https://www.covid19india.org/. This data is till 26th April.

# This project analyzes the current state that India is in while battling with COVID-19 pandemic and tries to answer the question of "How well are we doing as a nation". We try to answer this question by answering the following questions first.

# 1. How many people who are tested positive have recovered completely and how many have lost lives?

# 2. Which age-bracketed people are getting infected the most?

# 3. How many of the cases found are local and imported cases?

# 4. Which states have reached the epitome of community spread?

# Based on the findings of this project, I have written a Medium story which sums up all the questions and answers. Here is the link to the Medium Story : https://medium.com/@dixitprakhar94/covid-19-india-a-data-scientists-perspective-f63dd6957857
